## Getting Started
- Food Encyclopedia is a project to help citizens who have difficulty coping with daily food expenditures. It provides emergency and short-term dietary assistance. The dry food they supply includes rice, noodles, canned food, biscuits, and milk powder. Because these are the necessities of every family, many citizens want to know the more relevant information, such as the type of dry food, inventory, distribution station information. Because of this, we have developed a food bank management system through which citizens can query information about all food or delivery stations, as well as some back-up services.

## Features
